# Triangle Theory Application

## Overview

This project aims to create a web application that allows users to explore the theory of triangles. The application will provide functionalities to determine the type of triangle based on three given sides, classify it by angles and sides, and calculate its area and perimeter. The development process involves using Google to find relevant mathematical formulas, designing an interface prototype in draw.io, setting up a repository with NPM and SASS, and implementing the functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Mathematical Formulas

To determine the type of triangle and perform calculations, the necessary mathematical formulas will be sourced from Google. This includes formulas for classifying triangles by sides and angles, as well as calculating area and perimeter.

## Interface Prototype

A quick prototype of the interface will be designed using draw.io, incorporating a web palette for aesthetics. The prototype will be shared with peers for feedback, and the final application will prioritize the best user experience.

## Repository Initialization

Initialize the repository using the NPM package manager with the command `npm init -y`. Install the SASS library for styling.

```bash
npm init -y
npm install sass
```
## SASS Integration

Create essential files for the application: `index.html`, `base.scss`, and `style.css` (to be ignored by GitHub). Add styling to `base.scss` and compile it using the command:

```bash
sass base.scss style.css
```

## Initial HTML and CSS
Add the initial interface layout using HTML and CSS. Commit the changes.

## JavaScript Functions
Create necessary functions in triangle.js for conversions and validations. Commit the changes.

## Event Handling
Implement logic for handling user events in script.js, obtaining values from the interface, and displaying expected results. Make separate commits for each task.

## Documentation
Document the entire process on Notion.so for discussion with peers. Prepare to present and provide feedback during the group discussion.

Feel free to adapt and modify the README according to your project's specific details and requirements.
